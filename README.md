# Fast AI Fiction

Welcome to the Fast AI Fiction project! This project consists of two main parts: an HTML/CSS/JS web app and a Streamlit Python app. The web app hosts fictional stories and allows users to copy the text, while the Streamlit app generates text-to-speech audio for these stories.

## Project Structure

### Web App

The web app is hosted on GitHub Pages and provides an interface for reading fictional stories. Users can copy the text of a story and navigate to the Streamlit app to generate audio.
